## Digital System Project:1 # Dodge Through Bars Game


###  Project Overview:
In ‘Dodge Through Bars,’ our project aims to develop an engaging arcade-style game
 using the Basys 3 FPGA board. Players can control a block character through a series of
 upcoming obstacles, represented as rectangle bars on the screen. The objective is to avoid
 colliding with these bars while accumulating points to navigate the obstacles successfully.
 
  We will implement the game logic through Verilog programming, including
 player movement, obstacle generation, and the controlling system. Using the Basys 3
 board's buttons, players will be able to control the block character's movement on the
 up-down axis.
 
  We will utilize VGA communication to display the game graphics on an external
 monitor, making the game ‘Dodge Through Bars’ playable.
 
  This project will provide hands-on learning in digital logic, Verilog, and FPGA
 programming and real-time graphics for entertainment and educational purposes.

 ### 1. About The Game
####  1.1 Playable Boundary:

 The game boundary screen is visually represented as a rectangular display monitor area
 delineated by distinct borders or edges. Within this defined closed area, players can observe the
 movement of the block character and obstacles as they interact with the game environment. The
 player cannot move the block character outside this boundary.
 
 Inside the boundary, the player will aim to move the block up and down to dodge the
 obstacles coming towards it and save from any collision to gain a point.
