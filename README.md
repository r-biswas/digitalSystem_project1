## Digital System Project:1 # Dodge Through Bars Game


###  Project Overview:
In ‘Dodge Through Bars,’ our project aims to develop an engaging arcade-style game
 using the Basys 3 FPGA board. Players can control a block character through a series of
 upcoming obstacles, represented as rectangle bars on the screen. The objective is to avoid
 colliding with these bars while accumulating points to navigate the obstacles successfully.
 
  We will implement the game logic through Verilog programming, including
 player movement, obstacle generation, and the controlling system. Using the Basys 3
 board's buttons, players will be able to control the block character's movement on the
 up-down axis.
 
  We will utilize VGA communication to display the game graphics on an external
 monitor, making the game ‘Dodge Through Bars’ playable.
 
  This project will provide hands-on learning in digital logic, Verilog, and FPGA
 programming and real-time graphics for entertainment and educational purposes.
