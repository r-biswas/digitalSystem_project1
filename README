what we were supposed to do.
In ‘Dodge Through Bars,’ our project aims to develop an engaging arcade-style game using the Basys 3 FPGA board. 
Players can control a block character through a series of upcoming obstacles, represented as rectangle bars on the screen.
The objective is to avoid colliding with these bars while accumulating points to navigate the obstacles successfully.
