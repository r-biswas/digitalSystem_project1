what we were supposed to do.
In ‘Dodge Through Bars,’ our project aims to develop an engaging arcade-style game using the Basys 3 FPGA board. 
Players can control a block character through a series of upcoming obstacles, represented as rectangle bars on the screen.
The objective is to avoid colliding with these bars while accumulating points to navigate the obstacles successfully.

While doing the project we started to connect a monitor(vga cable) with FPGA  board, one the first day we got
error that pixels of monitor did not match with our pixel size, later on we have resolved them with the help of TA.
After that we encountered a problem when all 4 obstacles were showing but 3 of the of them were of different pattern.
